## Overview  

We chose to focus on the changes in minimum wage, the housing market, and affordability measures through inflation rates and the consumer price index as part of our analysis to answer:
1. How has the distribution of minimum wage changed over time, especially in comparison with the median household income? Are both livable earnings?
2. How was the housing market affected by the 2008 and 2020 recessions, when compared to non-recession time (around 2014-2015)
3. Have model predictions about inflation rates accurately captured the realized inflation rate, particularly around recessions? Do changes in these predictions seem to be acknowledged by the federal government through wage requirements?
4. Does our overall analysis tell us that there is a gap in the USA's wealth distribution today?
